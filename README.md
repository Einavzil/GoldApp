# GoldApp
A repository for a group project - GoldApp

## Description
The GoldApp is an online platform aimed at middle-aged and elderly people who are afflicted by loneliness and other mental health issues. It is an online community that provides its users with the opportunity to meet like-minded people to talk to and socialize with. Unlike other similar services, the Goldapp aims to be a one-stop connection hub aimed primarily at facilitating in-person meetups between seniors who are looking to get the most out of life. The platform aims to have a very easy-to-use layout because of the targeted demographic. The 3rd  UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) addresses health and well-being. It has been shown that loneliness and social isolation are linked to serious health conditions. The aim is to improve and sustain good mental health amongst senior citizens, who are generally more affected by this than other groups in society.
